        <h1 id="page-header">Soda Station 1</h1>
        <img src="images/soda1.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;height:auto;">        
        <ul style="margin-right:30px;">
            <li>Turn the key on the right side of the station to turn it off, and place the key into soda station 2</li>
            <li>Fill up the ice.</li>
            <li>Take the lemons and put a plastic lid on the container.</li>
            <li>Put the lemons in the walk-in, making sure its labeled!</li>
            <li>Empty out the ice from the lemon container and fill it with hot water from the coffee station</li>
            <li>Take off the nozzles (both clean and black) from the soda machine (gentle, they come off easy) and put them into the hot water to soak.</li>
            <li>Tip: Throw your knife and tongs into this hot water bath, if dish is busy you won't see it for a while.</li>
            <li>You need to clean a sweet and unsweet tea dispenser, make sure you are not leaving the serving staff with no tea!</li>
            <li>Empty out the lowest tea's you found into the dish straining sink. (right behind the wall!)</li>
            <li>Bring over the full tea dispensers to soda 2 so that your fellow serving staff don't need to walk accross the alley to get a tea!</li>
            <li>Take off the tea nozzles and take them apart. Add them to the hot water bath with the other nozzles.</li>
            <li>Use hot water to clean the tea dispensers, ensuring no sticky remnants exist inside or out.</li>
            <li>You may put your <i>clean</i> tea dispensers either next to soda 1 or to the right of the kids fridge. We just want them to be out of the way!</li>
            <li>take apart the soda station grate:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the metal grate</li>
                <li>The back wall behind the soda levers should lift up, and out of the station.</li>
                <li>Remove the plastic bottom that leads to the drain.</li>
                <li>Clean these three components very well, they can get very sticky.</li>
                <li>While you have the plastic component removed, you can clean under it. (This can get gross fast, so don't skip this!!)</li>
                <li>Return the components in order.. plastic first (make sure drain is aligned with hole), metal back wall second, and metal grate third</li>
                <li><i>The back wall should slot up into the top, make sure it is properly seated or else it could get stuck!</i></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Wipe off the station. Soda levers included!</li>
            <li>Stock up kids cups, lids (to the left), napkins, and straws.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have a knife and tongs, and your <i>clean</i> metal third pan.</li>
            <li>Bring up and put away any glasses that dish may have for you.</li>
            <li>Dump your nozzles into the station grate, and leave them off. Even the tea nozzles. To prevent mold, we leave them off to dry over-night.</li>
            <li>Your station should look like the picture above. (<i>Except with the tea nozzles off and on the grate)</i></li>
        </ul>
