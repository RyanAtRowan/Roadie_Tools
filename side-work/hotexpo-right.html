        <ul style="margin-right:30px;">
            <li><b>It is very important before you start this backwork that you know for a fact we are done with it for the night.</b></li>
            <li>You may ask a manager if you are not sure.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>Turn off the station using the knob. <i>The indicator light should be OFF</i></li>
            <li>Turn the drain on underneath the station by turning the red handled knob attached to the hose.</li>
            <li>Fill up crackers. They are found on the right side of the shelf under the salad window.</li>
            <li>Fill up wet napkins. They are found in the middle upper shelf under the kids fridge.</li>
            <li>Empty your sanitizer bucket and take it and the skewer pan to dish.</li> 
            <li>Take the bus pan to dish and empty out any dishes that may be in it.</li>
            <li>Take the buspan back to hot expo right.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>Empty the 'trash bin' and put it into the bus pan.</li>
            <li>Dump the contents of hot expo right into the trash. <b>If we still need something, save it in a monkey bowl and put it in the window.</b></li>
            <li>Place the empty expo containers into the bus pan.</li>
            <li>Place the ladels into the bus pan.</li>
            <li>Turn off the water for the scoop, and put any utencils from there into the bus pan.</li>
            <li>Empty out the water from the scoop holder (Its a removable circular holder) and add it to the bus pan.</li>
            <li>Put the grate, pan, and/or tongs from the prio-window into the bus pan.</li>
            <li>Do not give dish your dividers, they will get lost!</li>
            <li>Give this bus pan to dish, be respectful about where you leave it. Do not just leave it in the mucking station!</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>Now you need to clean the inside of the expo station. </li>
            <ul>
                <li>Get a Scrubbie (green or metal works) and a small bucket for soap.</li>
                <li>Scrub your dividers clean.</li>
                <li>Clean the top and bottom of the station, ensuring you do not have any black marks or grease left over.</li>
                <li>You can use this scrubbie to clean the window above the station (arms length is just fine), the ticket holders, and the prio-window.</li>
                <li>Once you have scrubbed the station clean, use a towel to dry it.</li>
            </ul>
            <br><br>
            <li>Usually dish will keep your bus pan contents together, however it can be incomplete or wrong sometimes.</li>
            <li>Here is a list of what you need in the station: </li>
            <ul>
                <li>4 metal "six pans" (square, deep)</li>
                <li>3 metal "nine pans" (rectangular, smallest)</li>
                <li>5 ladels</li>
                <li>1 plastic "six pan" (square, <b>shallow</b>)</li>
                <li>2 dividers</li>
            </ul>
            <li>In the scoop holder, you will need: </li>

            </ul>
            <br><br>

            <li>Most of the time, dish will not give you back the prio-window grate, pan, and tongs. </li>
            <li>The grate and pan can be found in dish on the green rack, on the middle shelf, to the left.</li>
            <li>Ladels can be found on the wall hanging over the sinks in dish.</li>
            <li>Your prio-window should be organized like so: </li>

            <br><br>
            <li>Make sure you have a clean bus pan, skewer pan (metal, <b>shallow</b>, "third pan"), and red sanitation bucket; <br><i>and</i> make sure they are flipped upside-down.</li>
            <li>Your station should look like the picture above.</li>
