        <ul style="margin-right:30px;">
            <li>Make sure you have at least 5 large <i>and</i> small ovals above the station.</li>
            <li>Fill up napkins.</li>
            <li>Fill up portion cups (Just like the picture, 1/2 small 1/2 big)</li>
            <li><i>If</i> there is a container of lids, fill it up! (1/2 small lids, 1/2 big lids)</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>Pull out items from the cold expo and clean the containers they are in.</li>
            <li>If you need to stock something, you <b>need</b> to get it from the walk-in <b>NOT</b> from below the station. (unless we don't have anymore)</li>
            <li>Discard the lemons, red onions, pickles, and parsley. <i>Save</i> the parmesan. Put a lid on it.</li>
            <li>Give dish your shakers, 3 "nine pans", and applesauce ladels.</li>
            <br><br>
            <li>While you have items out of the station, clean the inside of cold expo thoroughly.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Toothpicks, Burger picks, and Steak temp picks work really well to get the food out of cracks and corners of this station.</li>
            </ul>

            <br><br>
            <li>Now its time to clean the station.</li>
            <li>Its suggested that you use a scrubbie, a towel will work but takes longer.</li>
            <li>Clean the ticket holder, the window (arms length), <i>and</i> the shelf using the scrubbie.</li>
            <li>Clean the dividers of the station. The inside of cold expo can be cleaned with a scrubbie as well!</li>

            <br><br>
            <li>Once everything is clean and dry, you may reassemble the station</li>
            <li>You'll need to get lids for the food components and put back the ladels/nine pans/ shakers</li>
            <li>The station should look like the picture above, but here is a labeled image to make putting it back together easier: </li>

            <br><br>
            <li>If you <i>can</i> put the lid on expo please do so. It is understandable that it is kept quite high for some people so if you need assistance, just ask!</li>

        </ul>
